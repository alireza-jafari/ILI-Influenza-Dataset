# Influenza-Like-Illness (ILI) Forecasting on U.S. HHS Regions  
_A clean, reproducible starter kit_

![HHS Regions Map](figures/hhs_regions_map.png)

## 📑 Overview
This repository packages a **region-level, weekly ILI time-series dataset (2005 – 2025)** from the U.S. CDC FluView API together with data-prep utilities, cross-validation helpers, and example visualisations.  
It is designed to let researchers benchmark classical models (ARIMA, Prophet, etc.) and modern sequence models (Transformers, Time-LLMs) under two complementary evaluation protocols:

1. **Spatial hold-out** – train on 8 regions, test on 2 unseen regions (5-fold CV)  
2. **Temporal hold-out** – train on the first *N* weeks of every region, predict the most recent weeks

## 🔍 Data
| Field            | Description                                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `YEAR`, `WEEK`   | ISO calendar year / week number                        |
| `REGION`         | HHS region label (`Region 1` … `Region 10`)            |
| `% WEIGHTED ILI` | Main target – % of outpatient visits with ILI symptoms |
| `AGE …`, `ILITOTAL` | Optional covariates (age-stratified counts)        |

The raw export is stored in **`data/raw/ILINet.csv`** (≈ 10 kB). It is *already* cleaned for NaNs and sorted by region & week inside the generator scripts, so no heavy preprocessing is required beyond those utilities.

### What each script does
| Script | Purpose | Key I/O |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **`Data_Generator_ILI_HHS_LocationSplit.py`** | 5-fold **spatial CV**: choose one of the predefined train/test region splits and emit Pandas DataFrames for train & test. | Reads `ILINet.csv`; writes/returns `train_df`, `test_df` etc. (see example below) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} |
| **`Data_Generator_ILI_HHS_TimeSplit.py`** | **Temporal split**: last *k %* of each series becomes test, rest is train. | Same as above; user controls `--test_size`. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} |
| **`Utils.py`** | Tiny helpers: `splitter()` (row-level split per series) & `drop_last_n_samples()`. | Imported by both generators. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} |
| **`Plots.ipynb`** | Starter notebook: loads the processed DataFrames and recreates the line plot shown here; feel free to extend with your own model experiments. |
